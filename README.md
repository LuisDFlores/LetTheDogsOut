## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

A node server was created to host the site. An array of meme dog images was created to which was randomized when the user presses on the button "woof". With the use of flexbox and css the website was styled to a simple yet organized UI.

## Optimizations

More Images. To create and array of objects rather than of images to be able to include more information.  To improve code with practical coding conventions and simplify redundant code.

## Lessons Learned:

Node is amazing. API's are extremely helpful because making this felt very repetitive. Making sure to enable Json() request is extremely important as you want as many users as possible to benefit from
